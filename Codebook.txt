Feature Selection 
=================

The features in "tidydata" remains the mean and std values form the UCI HAR Dataset

tBodyAccXYZ
tGravityAccXYZ
tBodyAccJerkXYZ
tBodyGyroXYZ
tBodyGyroJerkXYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAccXYZ
fBodyAccJerkXYZ
fBodyGyroXYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'tidydata.txt'
